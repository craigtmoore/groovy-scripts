Useful command line scripts:

* **AddLineNumbers**
  * By default reads the contents of the clipboard and adds line numbers to it and then copies it to the clipboard
  * Can also read from an input file (instead of the clipboard)
  * Can also write the output to an output file (instead of putting the output in the clipboard)
